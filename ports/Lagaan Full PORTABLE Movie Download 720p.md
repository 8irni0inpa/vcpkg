Lagaan is not only a film but also a phenomenon that has inspired many filmmakers and audiences alike. The film was made with a lot of passion, dedication and hard work by the cast and crew, who faced many challenges and difficulties during the production. Here are some interesting trivia and facts about Lagaan that you may not know:
 
- Lagaan was the first Bollywood production in 30 years to use synchronized sound. An Arri535 camera, brought over from Germany, was used to facilitate sync-sound recording. Most Indian films are dubbed entirely in the studio in the process known as ADR[^1^].
- The film had the biggest number of British actors ever to be cast in a single movie in the history of Indian cinema[^1^]. Scottish actor Gerard Butler had also auditioned for the role of Captain Andrew Russel, but lost it to Paul Blackthorne[^2^]. Blackthorne found himself ashamed of his country after reading about the British Raj in India[^1^].
- The first cut of the film was 7 hours and 30 minutes long[^1^]. The final cut was 3 hours and 44 minutes long, making it one of the longest Indian films ever made. The film was divided into two parts for its theatrical release in some countries.
- Lagaan has many parallels with Bhuvan Shome (1969), a film by Mrinal Sen that is considered to be one of the pioneers of the Indian New Wave cinema. Amitabh Bachchan is the narrator in both the films. The hero and heroine's name are the same, Bhuvan and Gauri. Suhasini Mulay who played the heroine in Bhuvan Shome, played the hero's mother in Lagaan. Both films were shot in Gujarat[^1^].
- In the last days of shoots, a real match between British and Indian teams was played, which the British eventually won[^1^]. Aamir Khan wore his wife's earrings for the role of Bhuvan[^1^]. He also got his ears pierced so that he could actually wear earrings[^1^].
- Lagaan was India's official entry to the Academy Awards in the category of 'Best Foreign Language Film'. The film became 3rd Indian film to be nominated for an Oscar after Mother India (1957) and Salaam Bombay! (1988). It lost to No Man's Land (2001) from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
- Lagaan was the first Indian film to premiere in China. Aamir Khan would later become one of the most successful actors in this country with films like 3 Idiots (2009), PK (2014) and Dangal (2016).

Lagaan is a film that celebrates the spirit of freedom, unity and courage. It is a film that transcends boundaries of language, culture and time. It is a film that deserves to be watched and cherished by every generation.
