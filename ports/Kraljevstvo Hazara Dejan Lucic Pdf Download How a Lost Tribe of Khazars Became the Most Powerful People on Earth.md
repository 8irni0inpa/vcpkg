Kraljevstvo Hazara (The Kingdom of the Khazars) is a book by Dejan Lucic, a Serbian writer and researcher of geopolitics and conspiracy theories. The book explores the history and influence of the Khazars, a Turkic people who converted to Judaism and established a powerful empire in Eastern Europe and Central Asia between the 7th and 10th centuries. Lucic claims that the Khazars are the ancestors of many modern Jews, especially those of Ashkenazi origin, and that they have a hidden agenda to dominate the world through their control of finance, media, and politics.
 
The book is divided into two volumes: The First Volume covers the origins, rise, and fall of the Khazar Empire, while The Second Volume focuses on the role of the Khazars in contemporary events such as the creation of Israel, the wars in the Middle East, and the global financial crisis. Lucic also discusses the connections between the Khazars and various secret societies, such as the Freemasons, the Illuminati, and the Bilderberg Group.

One of the most vocal critics of Lucic's book is Dr. Zoran Milutinovic, a professor of South Slavic literature at University College London. In an article published in the journal Balcanica, Milutinovic argues that Lucic's book is based on dubious sources, selective evidence, and conspiracy thinking. He also accuses Lucic of promoting a nationalist and anti-Western agenda that undermines the values of democracy and human rights. Milutinovic concludes that Lucic's book is a "dangerous distortion of history" that should be exposed and rejected by the public .
