It was released on 02/09/2009 and it can bypass the protection mechanism of the following programs:  - Sound Forge 9.0 Series - Sound Forge Audio Studio 9.0 Series - DVD Architect Pro 4.5-5.0 Series - DVD Architect Studio 4.5 Series - Vegas Pro 8.0 Series - Vegas Pro 8.1 (64 bit) Series - Vegas Pro 9.0 (32 and 64 bit) Series - Vegas Movie Studio 8.0 Series - Vegas Movie Studio 9.0 Series - Vegas Movie Studio Platinum 8.0 Series - Vegas Movie Studio Platinum 9.0 Series - ACID Music Studio 7.0 Series - Acid Pro 7.0 Series - ACID Pro 6.0d (Build 363) - Cinescore 1.0c (Build 271) - Photo Go 1.0b (Build 123) - Noise Reduction Plugin 2.0h (Build 451) - Dolby Digital AC-3 Pro Plugin 1.0 (Build 3060) - MainConcept MPEG-1&2 Pro Plugin 2.0 (Build 2022)  NEW:  - Sound Forge 10.0 Series  To use this multikeygen, follow these steps:  1. Extract the files from the archive. 2. Run the keygen.exe file as an administrator if you are using Windows Vista or later. 3. Choose the product that you want to activate from the drop-down menu. 4. Close any Sony applications that are running on your computer. 5. Click on the Patch button and browse to the installation folder of the selected product.    (for example C:\Program Files\Sony\Vegas Pro 8.0) 6. If prompted, also select the Shared Plugins folder inside the installation folder. 7. Launch the product that you want to activate and enter the serial number and authentication code generated by the keygen.    (These codes work together and are different for each product.) 8. When asked to activate the product, choose the option to activate from Another Computer... 9. Enjoy your activated Sony software!  Note:  If you want to render your projects in AC-3 Pro format in Vegas Pro, you need to patch the Dolby Digital AC-3 Pro Plugin as well. To do this, select "DVD Architect Pro 4.5-5.0 Series" in the keygen, click on the Patch button, and then select the Sony Vegas Pro folder instead of the DVD Architect Pro folder. Click OK and ignore any errors that may appear. (It does not matter if the keygen says that the files are already patched or something else, it will still work fine.)  If you click on the Patch button and then on the Cancel button, the selected product will be unregistered. (If you only need a serial number for a new product, or a serial for a plugin, you do not have to patch anything. After registering a plugin, you need to restart the product.)
